Market Overview
</h3>
<p>The Qatari construction market is expected to register a CAGR of more than 10% over the period of 2022-2027 (hereafter referred to as the forecast period).​</p>
<p>The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic was negative on the Qatari construction sector. As the pandemic’s epicenter shifts from China to mainland Europe and the US, the Qatari construction sector is likely to face shortages of materials from these regions. Contractors in Qatar are particularly reliant on suppliers and manufacturers in Europe for mechanical, electrical, and plumbing products, and the supply shortage from Europe may lead contractors to find alternative suppliers. This may affect the prices of the goods themselves and raise questions about the cancellation of purchase orders and the termination of existing contracts.</p>
<p>Qatar's economy is likely to continue to grow for the foreseeable future due to the end of the embargo on Qatar (which was put in place in 2017) by the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), Qatar's National Vision for 2030, and its preparations for hosting the FIFA World Cup in 2022.</p>
<p>As a result of its commitment to hosting the 2022 FIFA World Cup, its commitment to its National Vision 2030, and its ambition to host the Asian Games in 2030, Qatar is undertaking an impressive array of infrastructure and industrial projects. The current Emir (in power since July 2013) is focusing on the country's domestic welfare by implementing the Second National Development Strategy. Launched in March 2018, the Second National Development Strategy sets national priorities aimed at transforming Qatar into a knowledge-based economy through infrastructural investments, economic diversification, private sector development, natural resources management, human development, sustainable social development, and sustainable environmental development. This strategy is being driven by expectations of growth for the economy through activities within the non-oil and gas sector, especially in the areas of merchandise and traded services.</p>

Key Market Trends
</h3>
<h4 class="component-subheading">
Government’s Focus on the Construction Sector
</h4>
<p>Government spending will play a crucial role in boosting the growth of the construction sector. According to Qatar’s 2021 budget, new projects worth QAR 53.9 billion have been identified. These infrastructure-related projects will be awarded from 2021 to 2023.</p>
<p>The government aims to develop infrastructure and diversify the economy away from its dependence on the oil and gas sector. In efforts to diversify the economy, Qatar has opened economic free zones that are attracting companies from across the world.</p>
<p>The endorsement of new laws regulating public-private partnerships (PPPs) is expected to attract private sector investment in developing Infrastructure, Educational Institutes, and healthcare projects, hence supporting industry growth during the forecast period. Investments in transportation infrastructure projects will also support growth during the forecast period. State-run Qatar Railways plans to begin construction of a rail line linking Qatar and Saudi Arabia later this year</p>
<p>In addition to building stadiums specifically to host World Cup matches, Qatar has been investing and continues to invest in modernizing its infrastructure. The goal is to become more of a transport hub for a significant part of the world. Top priorities are the development of airports, as well as a more extensive metropolitan network, along with upgraded roadways and emerging cities. As per the organizers of last summer’s Qatar Economic Forum, World Cup-related infrastructure projects are currently valued at USD 300 billion.</p>
<p>While some of the projects will have a long-term impact, the government already has many initiatives in place with concrete short-term benefits. For the medium term, the Qatari government has identified several urgent projects, earmarking QAR 54 billion (USD 15 billion) for these. In the second quarter of 2021, spending on major infrastructure projects totaled QAR 15 billion (USD 4 billion), or 20.8% of the state’s spending budget.</p>

Booming Realty Helping the Construction Sector
</h4>
<p>The prospects for the construction and realty sector appear to be brighter, especially outside the capital of Qatar. According to official statistics, there was a strong year-on-year surge in the building permits issued in five municipalities in October 2021 compared with an overall decline at the national level.</p>
<p>The total number of building permits issued in the country in October 2021 saw a 6.3% decline year-on-year, while Umm Slal recorded the highest growth of 42.9%, followed by Al Khor (25%), Al Shahaniya (20%), Al Wakra (16.7%), and Al Shamal (14.3%). In the case of Al Daayen, Doha, and Al Rayyan, there was a decrease of 28.7%, 22%, and 13.8%, respectively, in the period studied.</p>
<p>Qatar issued a total of 685 building permits in October 2021, with Al Rayyan, Al Wakra, and Al Daayen municipalities together constituting as much as 65% of the total as per figures released by the Planning and Statistics Authority (PSA).</p>
<p>On a monthly basis, there was a decrease of 7% in the number of building permits issued, with Al Daayen registering a 35% plunge, followed by Al Shamal (33%), Doha (21%), Al Shahaniya (17%), and Al Rayyan (1%). Meanwhile, there was a 31% increase in the case of Al Wakra, 18% in Al Khor, and 11% in Umm Slal.</p>
<p>The building permits data is of particular importance as it is considered an indicator of the performance of the construction sector, which in turn, occupies a significant position in the national economy.</p>

Along with the scope of the report also&nbsp;segmented by type of the construction like by fencing, additions and new building.</p>\n<h2>Key Market Trends</h2><h3>FIFA World Cup 2022</h3><p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in; text-align:justify\">The Qatar government has planned to spend around USD 103 billion&nbsp;on major infrastructure projects in preparations for the FIFA 2022 World Cup. The construction industry plays a very important role in achieving infrastructure development and thereby attracting foreign direct investments into the country, which is consistent with Qatar’s vision of becoming a leading hub in the region for world events, including the FIFA 2022 World Cup.</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in; text-align:justify\">The official budget for World Cup-specific construction ranges&nbsp;between USD 8 billion&nbsp;and USD 10 billion, although that is supported by the USD 200 billion&nbsp;being spent more generally to have a new metro system and huge infrastructure ready for 2022.</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in; text-align:justify\">Qatar is spending&nbsp;approximately around USD 500 million a week on capital projects;&nbsp;such as stadiums, training camps, athlete villages&nbsp;and infrastructure projects;&nbsp;such&nbsp;as roads, hospitals and transport hubs, which are necessary to make the country ready for 2022.</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in; text-align:justify\">The construction sector will witness more cooperation between local and international companies, as certain major projects for the World Cup must require particular expertise and resources.</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in; text-align:justify\"><strong>FIFA World Cup 2022- Host Stadiums</strong></p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in; text-align:justify\">North of the capital in Al Khor City, Al Bayt Stadium began to take shape in late 2016, with the site reporting 40% completion, in terms of structural work by April 2017. The stadium sits at the heart of a 1m-sq-meter site, which also includes a hospital, a mall, and a park. Work on the surrounding area was reported to be 25% complete in April 2017. The giant, tent-like stadium has some unique engineering features. When its retractable roof is shut, special cooling technologies will bring down the temperature inside, making the stadium usable in summer. The 60,000-seat venue has a modular structure so that sections can be removed after the World Cup.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in; text-align:justify\">Not all the stadiums are entirely new, with Khalifa International Stadium, which opened in 1976 in Al Rayyan, being given a major facelift for the World Cup. The 40,000-seat arena was the venue for the 2006 Asian Games, among other events, with the Aspire Zone Foundation now redeveloping the facility. The designer is Dar Al Handasah, with MIDMAC and Six Construct as the contractors. The stadium is adjacent to the existing Aspire Academy and the Aspetar facility, a global leader in sports and orthopedic medicine.&nbsp;The upgrade was completed in May 2017.</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Qatar National Vision 2030</h3><p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in; text-align:justify\">Under the Qatar National Vision&nbsp;2030, the country is set to award an estimated USD 85 billion worth of planned projects in the coming years. Out&nbsp;of these proposed&nbsp;projects (but unawarded), about USD 9.1 billion worth of projects are under study, while about USD 31.7 billion worth of projects are&nbsp;at some stage of tendering, and USD 44 billion projects are in the designing stage. About USD 12.1 billion worth of projects are&nbsp;planned or underway in the oil and gas project market. Upstream projects account for the lion's share (about 55%) of the country's oil and gas projects. Qatar’s ten biggest construction clients together have about USD 55.1 billion worth of projects in execution with Qatari Diar topping the list with about USD 18.5 billion of projects under construction. Barwa Real Estate Company was Qatar’s second-biggest construction client with about USD 10.9 billion worth of projects under construction followed by Msheireb Properties with about USD 5.7 billion worth of projects in execution.</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in; text-align:justify\">Qatari Diar’s biggest project is the USD 17 billion mixed-use Lusail Development. With huge gas reserves and considerable oil wealth, Qatar has enormous potential to generate abundant project opportunities, particularly in the natural gas sector, as it is the top exporter of liquefied natural gas globally.</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in; text-align:justify\">Upstream and downstream together account for more than 90% of the oil and gas projects market in Qatar, with a combined value of USD 20 billion share by value. The biggest oil and gas projects planned or underway in Qatar are the USD 6.4 billion Bul Hanine Field Redevelopment Project, USD 2 billion North Field Gas Development, and USD 700-million Barzan Gas Development Offshore.</p>\n<h2>Competitive Landscape</h2><p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in; text-align:justify\">The Qatari construction market is highly competitive, with the presence of major international players. The market presents opportunities for growth during the forecast period, which is expected to further drive market competition. With a few players holding a significant share, the UAE construction market has an observable level of consolidation.</p>\n<div class=\"wrap-item\"></div>"},"meta":{"tags":"Qatar Construction Market - Growth, Trends, and Forecast (2019 - 2024)","keywords":"qatar construction market","description":"Qatar Construction Market is poised to grow at a CAGR of 9.6% by 2024.

As the pandemic’s epicenter shifts from China to mainland Europe and the US, the Qatari construction sector is likely to face shortages of materials from these regions. Contractors in Qatar are particularly reliant on suppliers and manufacturers in Europe for mechanical, electrical, and plumbing products, and the supply shortage from Europe may lead contractors to find alternative suppliers. This may affect the prices of the goods themselves and raise questions about the cancellation of purchase orders and the termination of existing contracts.</p>\n<p>Qatar's economy is likely to continue to grow for the foreseeable future due to the end of the embargo on Qatar (which was put in place in 2017) by the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), Qatar's National Vision for 2030, and its preparations for hosting the FIFA World Cup in 2022.</p>\n<p>As a result of its commitment to hosting the 2022 FIFA World Cup, its commitment to its National Vision 2030, and its ambition to host the Asian Games in 2030, Qatar is undertaking an impressive array of infrastructure and industrial projects. The current Emir (in power since July 2013) is focusing on the country's domestic welfare by implementing the Second National Development Strategy. Launched in March 2018, the Second National Development Strategy sets national priorities aimed at transforming Qatar into a knowledge-based economy through infrastructural investments, economic diversification, private sector development, natural resources management, human development, sustainable social development, and sustainable environmental development.

Along with the scope of the report also&nbsp;segmented by type of the construction like by fencing, additions and new building.</p>\n<h2>Key Market Trends</h2><h3>FIFA World Cup 2022</h3><p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in; text-align:justify\">The Qatar government has planned to spend around USD 103 billion&nbsp;on major infrastructure projects in preparations for the FIFA 2022 World Cup. The construction industry plays a very important role in achieving infrastructure development and thereby attracting foreign direct investments into the country, which is consistent with Qatar’s vision of becoming a leading hub in the region for world events, including the FIFA 2022 World Cup.</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in; text-align:justify\">The official budget for World Cup-specific construction ranges&nbsp;between USD 8 billion&nbsp;and USD 10 billion, although that is supported by the USD 200 billion&nbsp;being spent more generally to have a new metro system and huge infrastructure ready for 2022.</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in; text-align:justify\">Qatar is spending&nbsp;approximately around USD 500 million a week on capital projects;&nbsp;such as stadiums, training camps, athlete villages&nbsp;and infrastructure projects;&nbsp;such&nbsp;as roads, hospitals and transport hubs, which are necessary to make the country ready for 2022.</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in; text-align:justify\">The construction sector will witness more cooperation between local and international companies, as certain major projects for the World Cup must require particular expertise and resources.</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in; text-align:justify\"><strong>FIFA World Cup 2022- Host Stadiums</strong></p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in; text-align:justify\">North of the capital in Al Khor City, Al Bayt Stadium began to take shape in late 2016, with the site reporting 40% completion, in terms of structural work by April 2017. The stadium sits at the heart of a 1m-sq-meter site, which also includes a hospital, a mall, and a park. Work on the surrounding area was reported to be 25% complete in April 2017. The giant, tent-like stadium has some unique engineering features. When its retractable roof is shut, special cooling technologies will bring down the temperature inside, making the stadium usable in summer. The 60,000-seat venue has a modular structure so that sections can be removed after the World Cup.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in; text-align:justify\">Not all the stadiums are entirely new, with Khalifa International Stadium, which opened in 1976 in Al Rayyan, being given a major facelift for the World Cup. The 40,000-seat arena was the venue for the 2006 Asian Games, among other events, with the Aspire Zone Foundation now redeveloping the facility. The designer is Dar Al Handasah, with MIDMAC and Six Construct as the contractors. The stadium is adjacent to the existing Aspire Academy and the Aspetar facility, a global leader in sports and orthopedic medicine.&nbsp;The upgrade was completed in May 2017.</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Qatar National Vision 2030</h3><p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in; text-align:justify\">Under the Qatar National Vision&nbsp;2030, the country is set to award an estimated USD 85 billion worth of planned projects in the coming years. Out&nbsp;of these proposed&nbsp;projects (but unawarded), about USD 9.1 billion worth of projects are under study, while about USD 31.7 billion worth of projects are&nbsp;at some stage of tendering, and USD 44 billion projects are in the designing stage. About USD 12.1 billion worth of projects are&nbsp;planned or underway in the oil and gas project market. Upstream projects account for the lion's share (about 55%) of the country's oil and gas projects. Qatar’s ten biggest construction clients together have about USD 55.1 billion worth of projects in execution with Qatari Diar topping the list with about USD 18.5 billion of projects under construction. Barwa Real Estate Company was Qatar’s second-biggest construction client with about USD 10.9 billion worth of projects under construction followed by Msheireb Properties with about USD 5.7 billion worth of projects in execution.</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in; text-align:justify\">Qatari Diar’s biggest project is the USD 17 billion mixed-use Lusail Development. With huge gas reserves and considerable oil wealth, Qatar has enormous potential to generate abundant project opportunities, particularly in the natural gas sector, as it is the top exporter of liquefied natural gas globally.</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in; text-align:justify\">Upstream and downstream together account for more than 90% of the oil and gas projects market in Qatar, with a combined value of USD 20 billion share by value. The biggest oil and gas projects planned or underway in Qatar are the USD 6.4 billion Bul Hanine Field Redevelopment Project, USD 2 billion North Field Gas Development, and USD 700-million Barzan Gas Development Offshore.</p>\n<h2>Competitive Landscape</h2><p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in; text-align:justify\">The Qatari construction market is highly competitive, with the presence of major international players. The market presents opportunities for growth during the forecast period, which is expected to further drive market competition. With a few players holding a significant share, the UAE construction market has an observable level of consolidation.</p>\n<div class=\"wrap-item\"></div>"},"meta":{"tags":"Qatar Construction Market - Growth, Trends, and Forecast (2019 - 2024)","keywords":"qatar construction market","description":"Qatar Construction Market is poised to grow at a CAGR of 9.6% by 2024.

Out&nbsp;of these proposed&nbsp;projects (but unawarded), about USD 9.1 billion worth of projects are under study, while about USD 31.7 billion worth of projects are&nbsp;at some stage of tendering, and USD 44 billion projects are in the designing stage. About USD 12.1 billion worth of projects are&nbsp;planned or underway in the oil and gas project market. Upstream projects account for the lion's share (about 55%) of the country's oil and gas projects. Qatar’s ten biggest construction clients together have about USD 55.1 billion worth of projects in execution with Qatari Diar topping the list with about USD 18.5 billion of projects under construction. Barwa Real Estate Company was Qatar’s second-biggest construction client with about USD 10.9 billion worth of projects under construction followed by Msheireb Properties with about USD 5.7 billion worth of projects in execution.</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in; text-align:justify\">Qatari Diar’s biggest project is the USD 17 billion mixed-use Lusail Development.

As the pandemic’s epicenter shifts from China to mainland Europe and the US, the Qatari construction sector is likely to face shortages of materials from these regions. Contractors in Qatar are particularly reliant on suppliers and manufacturers in Europe for mechanical, electrical, and plumbing products, and the supply shortage from Europe may lead contractors to find alternative suppliers. This may affect the prices of the goods themselves and raise questions about the cancellation of purchase orders and the termination of existing contracts.</p>\n<p>Qatar's economy is likely to continue to grow for the foreseeable future due to the end of the embargo on Qatar (which was put in place in 2017) by the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), Qatar's National Vision for 2030, and its preparations for hosting the FIFA World Cup in 2022.</p>\n<p>As a result of its commitment to hosting the 2022 FIFA World Cup, its commitment to its National Vision 2030, and its ambition to host the Asian Games in 2030, Qatar is undertaking an impressive array of infrastructure and industrial projects. The current Emir (in power since July 2013) is focusing on the country's domestic welfare by implementing the Second National Development Strategy. Launched in March 2018, the Second National Development Strategy sets national priorities aimed at transforming Qatar into a knowledge-based economy through infrastructural investments, economic diversification, private sector development, natural resources management, human development, sustainable social development, and sustainable environmental development. This strategy is being driven by expectations of growth for the economy through activities within the non-oil and gas sector, especially in the areas of merchandise and traded services.</p>\n"},{"order":2,"heading":"Scope of the Report","description":"<p>The construction market includes a wide range of activities that cover upcoming, ongoing, and growing construction projects in different sectors, which include but are not limited to geotechnical (underground structures) and superstructures in residential, commercial, and industrial structures as well as infrastructure construction (like roads, railways, and airports) and power generation and transmission related infrastructure.</p>\n<p>The report offers a complete background analysis of the construction sector, including an assessment and contribution of the sector to the economy, market overview, market size estimation for key segments, emerging trends in the market segments, market dynamics, etc. The report also covers the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the market.</p>\n<p>The Qatari construction market is segmented by type (commercial construction, residential construction, industrial construction, infrastructure (transportation) construction, and energy and utilities construction).

In efforts to diversify the economy, Qatar has opened economic free zones that are attracting companies from across the world.</p>\n<p>The endorsement of new laws regulating public-private partnerships (PPPs) is expected to attract private sector investment in developing Infrastructure, Educational Institutes, and healthcare projects, hence supporting industry growth during the forecast period. Investments in transportation infrastructure projects will also support growth during the forecast period.

The goal is to become more of a transport hub for a significant part of the world. Top priorities are the development of airports, as well as a more extensive metropolitan network, along with upgraded roadways and emerging cities. As per the organizers of last summer’s Qatar Economic Forum, World Cup-related infrastructure projects are currently valued at USD 300 billion.</p>\n<p>While some of the projects will have a long-term impact, the government already has many initiatives in place with concrete short-term benefits.
